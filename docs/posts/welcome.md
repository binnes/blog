## What is this blog about?

This blog is primarily developer‑focused, covering the technologies I encounter in my work and the tools that improve the developer workflow. While many posts will discuss IBM technology, I will also explore a broader range of solutions and ideas. The content reflects my personal thoughts and experiences and does not represent IBM.

## Who am I?

I was born in North‑East England and am a Geordie by birth. I spent a couple of years in Glasgow, Scotland, but the majority of my adult life has been on England’s south coast due to work.

I began working in retail finance at the age of sixteen, but quickly realised it was not a long‑term career for me. 

I earned a first‑class BSc (Hons) from [Newcastle University](https://www.ncl.ac.uk) and have worked in the IT industry ever since.

My career has included roles at:

- [Logica Finance](https://www.cgi.com/) (the parent company Logica was acquired by CGI Inc in 2012)
- [Abbey Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbey_Life)
- [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/uk-en)

I am approaching thirty years at IBM, having held many varied positions that have given me a broad view of enterprise computing.

My career at IBM spans nearly three decades, during which I have worked on a wide range of enterprise‑computing areas:

- I contributed to adding commerce to games before online gaming existed
- created mobile enterprise applications before smartphones were commonplace
- supporting partners in adopting IBM technology, including: 
    - enterprise Java development with IBM WebSphere products
    - work on the portal era
    - enterprise messaging
    - mobile applications
    - sensors and actuators (including RFID track‑and‑trace and MQTT telemetry)
    - artificial intelligence.
